Note:

	Resources on Amiga do not have a standard structure,
	other than it have to start with a 'struct Node'.

	Calling OpenResource( <Name> ), will not load from disk
	it only check SysBase->ResourceList for LN_Name.

	So a few uses the trick too define a Library, the structure
	also start with a Node plus we can now use LoadLibrary(), too
	load/start our resource code.
